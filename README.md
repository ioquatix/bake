# Bake ![Development](https://github.com/ioquatix/bake/workflows/Development/badge.svg)

Bake is a task execution tool, inspired by Rake, but codifying many of the use cases which are typically implemented in an ad-hoc manner.

![Example](example.png)

## Motivation

Rake is an awesome tool and loved by the community. So, why reinvent it? Bake provides the following features that Rake does not:

- On demand loading of files following a standard convention. This avoid loading all your rake tasks just to execute a single command.
- Better argument handling including support for positional and optional arguments.
- Focused on task execution not dependency resolution. Implementation is simpler and a bit more predictable.
- Canonical structure for integration with gems.

That being said, Rake and Bake can exist side by side in the same project.

## Installation

Execute the following in your project:

	bundle add bake

## Usage

Bake follows similar patterns to Rake.

## Bakefile

There is a root level `bake.rb` e.g.:

```ruby
def cake
	ingredients = call 'supermarket:shop', 'flour,sugar,cocoa'
	lookup('mixer:add').call(ingredients)
end
```

This file is project specific and is the only file which can expose top level tasks (i.e. without a defined namespace). When used in a gem, these tasks are not exposed to other gems/projects.

## Recipes

Alongside the `bake.rb`, there is a `bake/` directory which contains files like `supermarket.rb`. These files contain recipes, e.g.:

```ruby
# @param ingredients [Array(Any)] the ingredients to purchase.
def shop(ingredients)
	supermarket = Supermarket.best
	
	return supermarket.purchase(ingredients)
end
```

These methods are automatically scoped according to the file name, e.g. `bake/supermarket.rb` will define `supermarket:shop`.

## Gems

Adding a `bake/` directory to your gem will allow other gems and projects to consume those recipes. In order to prevent collisions, you *should* prefix your commands with the name of the gem, e.g. in `mygem/bake/mygem.rb`:

```ruby
def setup
	# ...
end
```

Then, in your project `myproject` which depends on `mygem`:

```
bake mygem:setup
```

## Arguments

Arguments work as normal. Documented types are used to parse strings from the command line. Both positional and optional parameters are supported.

### Positional Parameters

```ruby
# @param x [Integer]
# @param y [Integer]
def add(x, y)
	puts x + y
end
```

Which is invoked by `bake add 1 2`.

### Optional Parameters

```ruby
# @param x [Integer]
# @param y [Integer]
def add(x:, y:)
	puts x + y
end
```

Which is invoked by `bake add x=1 y=2`.
