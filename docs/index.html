	<h1>Bake</h1><main><p>Bake is a task execution tool, inspired by Rake, but codifying many of the use cases which are typically implemented in an ad-hoc manner.</p>

<section id="features"><h2>Features</h2>
<p>Rake is an awesome tool and loved by the community. So, why reinvent it? Bake provides the following features that Rake does not:</p>
<ul>
<li>On demand loading of files following a standard convention. This avoid loading all your rake tasks just to execute a single command.</li>
<li>Better argument handling including support for positional and optional arguments.</li>
<li>Focused on task execution not dependency resolution. Implementation is simpler and a bit more predictable.</li>
<li>Canonical structure for integration with gems.</li>
</ul>
<p>That being said, Rake and Bake can exist side by side in the same project.</p>
