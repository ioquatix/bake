<h1>Bake</h1>
	
	
<p>Bake is a task execution tool, inspired by Rake, but codifying many of the use cases which are typically implemented in an ad-hoc manner.</p>

<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>

<p>Rake is an awesome tool and loved by the community. So, why reinvent it? Bake provides the following features that Rake does not:</p>

<ul>
  <li>On demand loading of files following a standard convention. This avoid loading all your rake tasks just to execute a single command.</li>
  <li>Better argument handling including support for positional and optional arguments.</li>
  <li>Focused on task execution not dependency resolution. Implementation is simpler and a bit more predictable.</li>
  <li>Canonical structure for integration with gems.</li>
</ul>

<p>That being said, Rake and Bake can exist side by side in the same project.</p>

<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>

<p>Execute the following in your project:</p>

<pre><code>bundle add bake
</code></pre>
